			Founder's Notes
		</h2>
		<p id="f_notes">
			The Weinreb School approach was developed by Melanie Weinreb and Lorne Weinreb after careful research into early childhood development. As parents of two, they wanted to provide their children with the tools that they would need to succeed early on in their academic lives.​​</br></br>
 
Melanie, an elementary school teacher, was keenly aware of the need for students to learn at their own individual pace. In a regular public school classroom, when students are facing difficulties in class, they are not always able to receive the time and personalized attention that they need because they have to share the one teacher with 29 other children. As such, students often develop weaknesses in their studies, lose confidence, and are not able to reach their full potential. Melanie wanted to ensure that her children received the absolute best in education, so she worked to develop a program that would guide students along their entire learning process.</br></br>
 
Lorne, who has had 12 years of experience working with, and mentoring, exceptional university students, noticed that the brightest students always had an early start in math education. Some of the students Lorne mentored over the years have included Ivy League economics and finance graduates (Harvard, Wharton) and top Canadian national scholarship recipients. He discovered that these students had all received supplementary math lessons as children. Lorne wanted his children to have the same opportunities.
