		<p>Weinreb School is an early childhood math development program meant to help children reach their full potential. Through consistent effort and a unique pedagogical approach, we endeavour to have our students develop a strong understanding of mathematical concepts. We teach with the goal of maximizing each of our studentsâ€™ potential and helping them come to appreciate and enjoy what they are learning.</p></br>

		<p>Having consistent practice is the key to success in mathematics. Students attend our class each day after school where they will follow an enhanced curriculum with other children of their skill level.  The Weinreb School curriculum caters to children as young as age 4.</p></br>

		<p>Weinreb School is dedicated to teaching students relavent information that will help them during their academic career for the rest of their lives. Students have been able to perform at a high school level or a middle school level at an early age. </p></br>

		<p>Teaching students a sense of budgeting money and valuables is also an important focus of the program.</p></br>
		<p>Theoretical, Practical and Commercial. These are the three stages of learning a student will go through during their time at the Weinreb School. These three unique though closely related stages will allow students to go above and beyond during their lives. Teaching the student how to apply themsevles at this age will allow them to prosper in the future. </p></br>
