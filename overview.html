			<h1>Our Philosophy</h2>
			<h3>We provide children with a solid foundation from a young age</h3>
			<p>Most students who excel in high school and university have done so throughout their entire academic career, starting from kindergarten. That trend is even more predominant when it comes to math, because each year, the material taught in school requires students to have mastered the material from previous years. Once a child falls behind, it becomes exponentially harder to catch up. Hence, we believe in teaching children the building blocks of math from an early age to ensure that they are never left behind.​</p>
			<h3>We cater our teaching to each studen't learning preferences</h3>
			<p>All children have the potential to become great mathematicians, but that potential has to be properly developed. If a student does not understand something, the fault lies with the teacher, not the student. Some children find multiplication easy but fractions difficult, whereas other students are the exact opposite — each child is unique. Different students have different strengths, weaknesses and learning styles.  By working in small groups, we ensure that each student is learning at a pace that is optimal for him or her. More time can be devoted to working on areas of difficulty, and less time can be spent on areas at which a student already excels.</p>
			<h3>We believe in having children apply what they learn</h3>
			<p>Children learn best when they can see what they learned in action. It is too common for students (even in high school!) to say “I will never use math, so why do I have to learn it?”. This lack of appreciation for the subject is the result of not being shown how it is applied in the real world, despite the fact that math is the language of physics, engineering, finance, statistics, computer science, and many other fields. By giving students the opportunity to use the math they learn, they will not only learn quicker, but will also enjoy the learning experience more.</p>
